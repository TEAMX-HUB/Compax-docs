A well-designed database schema ensures efficient data storage, retrieval, and integrity. Below is an elaboration of the database design and schema for the Compax web app: Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) : An Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) is a visual representation of the database schema, showing the entities (tables) and their relationships. The ERD for the Compax web app might include the following entities: Users : Represents information about the users of the application, including regular users, administrators, and exam officers. It stores user details such as username, email, password (hashed), role, and other relevant information. Buildings : Contains details about the different buildings available within the educational institution. Information may include building name, address, capacity, etc. Classrooms : Stores information about individual classrooms within the buildings. It may include attributes like classroom number, seating capacity, facilities, and the associated building. Laboratories : Similar to classrooms, this entity stores details about laboratories, such as lab number, equipment, capacity, and the corresponding building. Offices : Contains information about offices within the institution, such as office number, occupant, contact details, etc. Ratings : Stores ratings and reviews given by users for classrooms and laboratories. It may include attributes like user ID, classroom/laboratory ID, rating value, review text, etc. Bookings : Tracks bookings made by users for specific classrooms or laboratories. It includes details like user ID, classroom/laboratory ID, booking date, start time, end time, and status. The ERD provides a clear visualization of the relationships between different entities and helps in understanding how data is interconnected within the database. Table Structure and Data Types : The table structure for each entity in the database is defined by specifying the columns (attributes) and their corresponding data types. For example: Users Table : id : Primary key, auto-incremented integer. username : Unique string, used for user identification. email : Unique email address of the user. password_hash : Hashed representation of the user's password for security. role : Enum field representing the user's role (regular, admin, exam officer). created_at : Timestamp indicating when the user account was created. updated_at : Timestamp indicating the last update to the user account. Classrooms Table : id : Primary key, auto-incremented integer. classroom_number : String representing the classroom number or identifier. capacity : Integer specifying the seating capacity of the classroom. building_id : Foreign key referencing the ID of the associated building. Bookings Table : id : Primary key, auto-incremented integer. user_id : Foreign key referencing the ID of the user making the booking. classroom_id : Foreign key referencing the ID of the booked classroom. booking_date : Date when the booking was made. start_time : Time of the booking's start. end_time : Time of the booking's end. status : Enum field indicating the booking status (confirmed, pending, canceled, etc.). The choice of data types for each column ensures that the database efficiently stores and retrieves the data, while also enforcing data integrity constraints. Normalization and Data Integrity : Database normalization is applied to ensure data integrity and to reduce data redundancy. The schema is organized into multiple tables, with each table focused on a specific entity. Relationships between entities are established using foreign keys, maintaining referential integrity. Indexes and Performance Optimization : Proper indexing is essential for improving query performance. Indexes are created on columns that are frequently used for filtering or searching data, such as the user ID, building ID, classroom ID, etc. Additionally, unique constraints and primary keys help maintain data uniqueness and integrity. Real-time Data (Supabase, Optional) : If the application requires real-time data updates, features like real-time notifications for bookings or reviews, Supabase can be used as an optional addition to the database stack. The database design and schema should be carefully planned and optimized to meet the specific requirements of the Compax web app. Regular backups and maintenance procedures should be implemented to ensure data reliability and security.","title":"Database Design and Schema"},{"location":"database_design_and_schema/#database-design-and-schema","text":"The database design and schema for the Compax web app are crucial components that define the structure and organization of data within the application.

Here's an elaboration on the security measures and authentication methods used in the Compax web app: Secure Communication (HTTPS) : All communication between the frontend and backend of the Compax web app should be encrypted using HTTPS (HTTP Secure). HTTPS ensures that data transmitted between the client and server is encrypted, preventing eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks. Authentication with JSON Web Tokens (JWT) : JSON Web Tokens (JWT) are used for user authentication in the Compax web app. When a user successfully logs in, the backend generates a JWT containing user information and a signature. This token is then sent back to the client and included in subsequent requests as an Authorization header. The server verifies the JWT's authenticity and extracts user information from it to grant access to protected endpoints. JWTs are stateless, meaning the server does not need to store session data, reducing server-side overhead. Hashing and Salting Passwords : User passwords should never be stored in plaintext. Instead, they are hashed and salted before being stored in the database. Hashing transforms the password into an irreversible string, while salting adds additional randomness to the hashing process, making it more secure against brute-force attacks. User Roles and Permissions : Different user roles (regular users, administrators, exam officers) have varying levels of access to the application's functionalities. Role-based access control (RBAC) is implemented to ensure that users can only access features relevant to their roles. Rate Limiting : Rate limiting is implemented to prevent brute-force attacks and excessive API requests from a single client. By imposing limits on the number of requests a client can make within a specific time frame, the backend mitigates potential abuse. Input Validation and Sanitization : Input validation is crucial to prevent security vulnerabilities like SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS). All user inputs should be validated and sanitized before processing to avoid malicious code execution. Error Handling and Logging : Comprehensive error handling is implemented to provide users with appropriate error messages while avoiding exposing sensitive information. Logs are generated to monitor application behavior and identify potential security issues. - Session Management (Optional) : While the Compax web app primarily uses stateless JWT authentication, session management can be an alternative for certain scenarios. Implementing secure session management involves handling session tokens, expiration, and ensuring secure storage. Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) : CORS is configured on the backend to restrict cross-origin requests and prevent unauthorized access from different domains. Content Security Policy (CSP) : - CSP is used to specify the sources from which the application can load resources like scripts, stylesheets, and images. It helps prevent code injection attacks. Authentication and Authorization Middleware : - Custom middleware can be developed and applied to endpoints to enforce authentication and authorization rules across the application. Regular Security Audits : - Regular security audits and penetration testing should be conducted to identify and address potential vulnerabilities proactively. By implementing these security measures and authentication methods, the Compax web app can maintain a high level of security and protect user data from unauthorized access and malicious attacks.
