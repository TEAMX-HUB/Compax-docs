Use resource-based URLs and appropriate HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) for operations. Endpoint Naming: Use descriptive and meaningful names for endpoints that reflect the action being performed. Request and Response Formats: Define consistent request and response formats, such as JSON, to ensure compatibility and ease of integration with the frontend. Versioning: Consider versioning the APIs to maintain backward compatibility and allow for future enhancements. Authentication and Authorization: Implement appropriate authentication and authorization mechanisms, such as token-based authentication (e.g., JWT), to secure access to protected endpoints.","title":"API Design Principles"},{"location":"API_design_principles/#api-design-principles","text":"When designing APIs for the Compax web app, it's important to follow these best practices to ensure consistency, ease of use, and scalability: RESTful Design: Design the APIs following the principles of Representational State Transfer (REST).

Scalability Microservices: If required, the backend can be designed as microservices, with separate services responsible for user management, classroom management, and booking management. This allows independent scaling of different components based on demand. Caching: Implement caching mechanisms, such as Redis or in-memory caches, to store frequently accessed data and reduce the load on the database. Load Balancing: Introduce load balancing techniques, such as using a reverse proxy or a load balancer, to distribute incoming requests across multiple backend servers. Performance Asynchronous Operations: Utilize asynchronous programming techniques, such as Python's async/await or asynchronous task queues (e.g., Celery), to handle time-consuming operations without blocking other requests. Optimized Queries: Optimize database queries by indexing the relevant fields and minimizing the number of database queries required for each operation. Caching: Cache frequently accessed data to reduce the need for repeated database queries and improve response times. Security Authentication and Authorization: Implement secure user authentication using techniques like JWT (JSON Web Tokens) or OAuth2. Ensure that only authenticated users can access protected endpoints. Use authorization mechanisms, such as role-based access control (RBAC), to restrict access to specific resources. Input Validation: Validate and sanitize user input to prevent security vulnerabilities like SQL injection or cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. Secure Communication: Enable secure communication between the frontend and backend by using HTTPS and SSL/TLS certificates. Error Handling and Logging Error Handling: Implement proper error handling mechanisms to catch and handle exceptions gracefully. Return appropriate error responses to the frontend, including error codes, messages, and relevant details. Logging: Implement logging to capture important events, errors, and debugging information. Use a logging library like Python's logging to store logs for analysis and troubleshooting. Testing and Deployment Unit and Integration Testing: Write automated tests for each component to ensure correct functionality and identify issues early in the development process. Continuous Integration and Deployment: Utilize CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) pipelines to automate the testing and deployment process. Use tools like Jenkins, Travis CI, or GitLab CI/CD to streamline the development workflow. The backend architecture and system design aim to provide a scalable, performant, and secure foundation for the Compax web application. By following best practices and leveraging appropriate technologies, the backend ensures the smooth operation of the application and supports its growth and maintenance over time.","title":"System Design"},{"location":"system_design/#system-design","text":"The system design of the Compax backend focuses on scalability, performance, and security.","title":"System Design"},{"location":"system_design/#scalability","text":"Microservices: If required, the backend can be designed as microservices, with separate services responsible for user management, classroom management, and booking management.
