A well-designed database schema ensures efficient data storage, retrieval, and integrity. Below is an elaboration of the database design and schema for the Compax web app: Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) : An Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) is a visual representation of the database schema, showing the entities (tables) and their relationships. The ERD for the Compax web app might include the following entities: Users : Represents information about the users of the application, including regular users, administrators, and exam officers. It stores user details such as username, email, password (hashed), role, and other relevant information. Buildings : Contains details about the different buildings available within the educational institution. Information may include building name, address, capacity, etc. Classrooms : Stores information about individual classrooms within the buildings. It may include attributes like classroom number, seating capacity, facilities, and the associated building. Laboratories : Similar to classrooms, this entity stores details about laboratories, such as lab number, equipment, capacity, and the corresponding building. Offices : Contains information about offices within the institution, such as office number, occupant, contact details, etc. Ratings : Stores ratings and reviews given by users for classrooms and laboratories. It may include attributes like user ID, classroom/laboratory ID, rating value, review text, etc. Bookings : Tracks bookings made by users for specific classrooms or laboratories. It includes details like user ID, classroom/laboratory ID, booking date, start time, end time, and status. The ERD provides a clear visualization of the relationships between different entities and helps in understanding how data is interconnected within the database. Table Structure and Data Types : The table structure for each entity in the database is defined by specifying the columns (attributes) and their corresponding data types. For example: Users Table : id : Primary key, auto-incremented integer. username : Unique string, used for user identification. email : Unique email address of the user. password_hash : Hashed representation of the user's password for security. role : Enum field representing the user's role (regular, admin, exam officer). created_at : Timestamp indicating when the user account was created. updated_at : Timestamp indicating the last update to the user account. Classrooms Table : id : Primary key, auto-incremented integer. classroom_number : String representing the classroom number or identifier. capacity : Integer specifying the seating capacity of the classroom. building_id : Foreign key referencing the ID of the associated building. Bookings Table : id : Primary key, auto-incremented integer. user_id : Foreign key referencing the ID of the user making the booking. classroom_id : Foreign key referencing the ID of the booked classroom. booking_date : Date when the booking was made. start_time : Time of the booking's start. end_time : Time of the booking's end. status : Enum field indicating the booking status (confirmed, pending, canceled, etc.). The choice of data types for each column ensures that the database efficiently stores and retrieves the data, while also enforcing data integrity constraints. Normalization and Data Integrity : Database normalization is applied to ensure data integrity and to reduce data redundancy. The schema is organized into multiple tables, with each table focused on a specific entity. Relationships between entities are established using foreign keys, maintaining referential integrity. Indexes and Performance Optimization : Proper indexing is essential for improving query performance. Indexes are created on columns that are frequently used for filtering or searching data, such as the user ID, building ID, classroom ID, etc. Additionally, unique constraints and primary keys help maintain data uniqueness and integrity. Real-time Data (Supabase, Optional) : If the application requires real-time data updates, features like real-time notifications for bookings or reviews, Supabase can be used as an optional addition to the database stack.

Proper error handling provides meaningful feedback to users and helps developers identify and fix issues quickly. Here's an elaboration on error handling and logging for the backend of the Compax web app: Custom Error Classes : Define custom error classes that inherit from FastAPI.HTTPException for various types of errors. These custom error classes allow you to provide consistent and informative error responses to the client. ```python from fastapi import HTTPException class NotFoundException(HTTPException): def init (self, detail: str = \"Not found\"): super(). init (status_code=404, detail=detail) class UnauthorizedException(HTTPException): def init (self, detail: str = \"Unauthorized\"): super(). init (status_code=401, detail=detail) ``` Global Exception Handler Middleware : Implement a global exception handler middleware to catch unhandled exceptions and provide consistent error responses to the client. ```python from fastapi import Request from fastapi.exceptions import RequestValidationError from fastapi.responses import JSONResponse async def global_exception_handler(_: Request, exc: Exception) -> JSONResponse: if isinstance(exc, RequestValidationError): return JSONResponse( status_code=400, content={\"detail\": \"Validation Error\", \"errors\": exc.errors()}, ) elif isinstance(exc, HTTPException): return JSONResponse( status_code=exc.status_code, content={\"detail\": exc.detail}, ) else: # Log unexpected exceptions # ... return JSONResponse( status_code=500, content={\"detail\": \"Server Error\"}, ) ``` Logging : Implement logging to record application events, errors, and debugging information. Use Python's built-in logging module or third-party libraries like structlog to handle logging effectively. ```python import logging logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO) logger = logging.getLogger(\"compax\") # Log an error try: # Code that may raise an exception except Exception as e: logger.exception(\"An error occurred:\", exc_info=e) ``` Request and Response Logging : Consider logging incoming requests and outgoing responses to understand application flow and debug issues. Handling Expected Errors : For known and expected errors, raise custom error classes with appropriate status codes and error details. ```python from fastapi import FastAPI from .errors import NotFoundException app = FastAPI() @app.get(\"/item/{item_id}\") def read_item(item_id: int): item = get_item_from_database(item_id) if item is None: raise NotFoundException(\"Item not found\") return item ``` Unit Tests for Error Handling : Write unit tests to ensure that the error handling and responses are working as expected. Sensitive Information Handling : Ensure that error responses do not expose sensitive information that could be used for malicious purposes. By implementing robust error handling and logging in the backend, the Compax web app can provide informative error responses to clients, facilitate debugging, and enhance the overall reliability and user experience. Proper logging helps identify potential issues early and enables developers to respond quickly to errors, improving the stability and security of the application.","title":"Error handling and logging"},{"location":"security_measures_and_authentication/","text":"Security Measures and Authentication Security is a critical aspect of any web application, and the Compax web app must implement robust measures to protect user data, prevent unauthorized access, and ensure secure communication between the frontend and backend. Here's an elaboration on the security measures and authentication methods used in the Compax web app: Secure Communication (HTTPS) : All communication between the frontend and backend of the Compax web app should be encrypted using HTTPS (HTTP Secure). HTTPS ensures that data transmitted between the client and server is encrypted, preventing eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks. Authentication with JSON Web Tokens (JWT) : JSON Web Tokens (JWT) are used for user authentication in the Compax web app. When a user successfully logs in, the backend generates a JWT containing user information and a signature. This token is then sent back to the client and included in subsequent requests as an Authorization header. The server verifies the JWT's authenticity and extracts user information from it to grant access to protected endpoints. JWTs are stateless, meaning the server does not need to store session data, reducing server-side overhead. Hashing and Salting Passwords : User passwords should never be stored in plaintext. Instead, they are hashed and salted before being stored in the database. Hashing transforms the password into an irreversible string, while salting adds additional randomness to the hashing process, making it more secure against brute-force attacks. User Roles and Permissions : Different user roles (regular users, administrators, exam officers) have varying levels of access to the application's functionalities. Role-based access control (RBAC) is implemented to ensure that users can only access features relevant to their roles. Rate Limiting : Rate limiting is implemented to prevent brute-force attacks and excessive API requests from a single client. By imposing limits on the number of requests a client can make within a specific time frame, the backend mitigates potential abuse. Input Validation and Sanitization : Input validation is crucial to prevent security vulnerabilities like SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS). All user inputs should be validated and sanitized before processing to avoid malicious code execution. Error Handling and Logging : Comprehensive error handling is implemented to provide users with appropriate error messages while avoiding exposing sensitive information. Logs are generated to monitor application behavior and identify potential security issues. - Session Management (Optional) : While the Compax web app primarily uses stateless JWT authentication, session management can be an alternative for certain scenarios. Implementing secure session management involves handling session tokens, expiration, and ensuring secure storage. Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) : CORS is configured on the backend to restrict cross-origin requests and prevent unauthorized access from different domains. Content Security Policy (CSP) : - CSP is used to specify the sources from which the application can load resources like scripts, stylesheets, and images. It helps prevent code injection attacks. Authentication and Authorization Middleware : - Custom middleware can be developed and applied to endpoints to enforce authentication and authorization rules across the application. Regular Security Audits : - Regular security audits and penetration testing should be conducted to identify and address potential vulnerabilities proactively. By implementing these security measures and authentication methods, the Compax web app can maintain a high level of security and protect user data from unauthorized access and malicious attacks. Remember that security is an ongoing process, and it's essential to stay up-to-date with security best practices and address new threats as they arise.","title":"Security Measures and Authentication"},{"location":"security_measures_and_authentication/#security-measures-and-authentication","text":"Security is a critical aspect of any web application, and the Compax web app must implement robust measures to protect user data, prevent unauthorized access, and ensure secure communication between the frontend and backend.

Scalability Microservices: If required, the backend can be designed as microservices, with separate services responsible for user management, classroom management, and booking management. This allows independent scaling of different components based on demand. Caching: Implement caching mechanisms, such as Redis or in-memory caches, to store frequently accessed data and reduce the load on the database. Load Balancing: Introduce load balancing techniques, such as using a reverse proxy or a load balancer, to distribute incoming requests across multiple backend servers. Performance Asynchronous Operations: Utilize asynchronous programming techniques, such as Python's async/await or asynchronous task queues (e.g., Celery), to handle time-consuming operations without blocking other requests. Optimized Queries: Optimize database queries by indexing the relevant fields and minimizing the number of database queries required for each operation. Caching: Cache frequently accessed data to reduce the need for repeated database queries and improve response times. Security Authentication and Authorization: Implement secure user authentication using techniques like JWT (JSON Web Tokens) or OAuth2. Ensure that only authenticated users can access protected endpoints. Use authorization mechanisms, such as role-based access control (RBAC), to restrict access to specific resources. Input Validation: Validate and sanitize user input to prevent security vulnerabilities like SQL injection or cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. Secure Communication: Enable secure communication between the frontend and backend by using HTTPS and SSL/TLS certificates. Error Handling and Logging Error Handling: Implement proper error handling mechanisms to catch and handle exceptions gracefully.
