# API Design Principles
**********************************************************************************
When designing APIs for the Compax web app, it's important to follow these best practices to ensure consistency, ease of use, and scalability:

- RESTful Design: Design the APIs following the principles of Representational State Transfer (REST). Use resource-based URLs and appropriate HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) for operations.

- Endpoint Naming: Use descriptive and meaningful names for endpoints that reflect the action being performed.

- Request and Response Formats: Define consistent request and response formats, such as JSON, to ensure compatibility and ease of integration with the frontend.

- Versioning: Consider versioning the APIs to maintain backward compatibility and allow for future enhancements.

- Authentication and Authorization: Implement appropriate authentication and authorization mechanisms, such as token-based authentication (e.g., JWT), to secure access to protected endpoints.
